      <p>
        <strong>Galaxy Explorer</strong> is a cloud-native, large-scale astrophysical visualization platform built on the
        European Space Agency’s Gaia DR3 catalog. The system enables real-time 3D exploration of over
        <strong>557 million scientifically filtered stars</strong>, including physically accurate temporal projection
        using stellar proper motion and radial velocity vectors.
      </p>

      <p>
        Designed as a full-stack big data engineering project, the platform demonstrates scalable query architecture,
        distributed data processing, GPU-accelerated browser rendering, and serverless cloud deployment.
        Unlike static star maps, Galaxy Explorer dynamically computes stellar positions for arbitrary epochs,
        allowing users to navigate both space and time within our galactic neighborhood.

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Data Engineering & Big Data Architecture</h2>

      <p class="subsection-title">Dataset Scale & Storage Strategy</p>
      <p>
        The system is powered by the Gaia DR3 dataset (originally ~1.8 billion sources),
        filtered to approximately <strong>557 million high-confidence stars</strong>.
        Data is stored in Google BigQuery using a columnar, serverless architecture
        optimized for analytical workloads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tables are partitioned and clustered to minimize scan size and cost.
        Spatial filtering is performed using Healpix indexing, and range queries
        are optimized for distance-based selection (light years). This design enables
        sub-second queries over gigabyte-scale datasets without infrastructure management.
      </p>

      <p class="subsection-title">Query Optimization & Cost Efficiency</p>
      <p>
        Queries are dynamically generated and parameterized to ensure security and performance.
        Only required columns are selected, full table scans are avoided, and filtering
        is applied before projection calculations. The architecture is designed to remain
        within BigQuery’s free query tier whenever possible while maintaining predictable per-query cost.
      </p>

      <p class="subsection-title">Proper Motion & Kinematic Projection Engine</p>
      <p>
        To provide physically meaningful visualization, the backend implements a simplified
        stellar kinematic model. Right ascension, declination, and parallax values are converted
        to Cartesian coordinates. Proper motion (pmRA, pmDec) and radial velocity vectors are applied
        to project positions forward or backward in time:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>position(t) = position(t₀) + velocity × Δt</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        These calculations occur dynamically during query execution, enabling real-time
        epoch simulation directly from the cloud database.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Full-Stack System Design</h2>

      <p class="subsection-title">Backend (Cloud-Native API)</p>
      <p>
        The backend is a containerized Python application built with FastAPI and deployed
        on Google Cloud Run. It handles request validation, secure SQL generation,
        BigQuery job execution, and JSON streaming to the frontend.
        The service is stateless and auto-scales based on traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key engineering principles include:
        <br>• Parameterized SQL for injection safety
        <br>• Compute pushed to the data layer
        <br>• Minimal network payload size
        <br>• Serverless deployment with automatic scaling
      </p>

      <p class="subsection-title">Frontend (GPU-Accelerated Rendering)</p>
      <p>
        The frontend is built using React and React Three Fiber (Three.js).
        Instead of rendering individual components per star, the system uses
        a single optimized <code>BufferGeometry</code> particle system for
        high-performance WebGL rendering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Features include:
        <br>• Hardware-accelerated 3D star field rendering
        <br>• Magnitude-based color mapping
        <br>• Interactive orbit controls
        <br>• Hover state inspection
        <br>• Dynamic camera scaling
      </p>
      <p>
        The system maintains smooth performance (≈60 FPS on modern hardware)
        while rendering tens of thousands of stars simultaneously.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users can filter the galaxy by distance (light years), spatial sector (Healpix),
        stellar magnitude, and simulation year. The system executes optimized cloud queries
        and renders the resulting star field in a fully interactive 3D environment.

    <!-- ===================== NIGHT SKY SECOND (UNCHANGED CONTENT) ===================== -->

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Night Sky Explorer</h2>
      <p>
        The Night Sky Explorer offers users an accurate, real-time view of the night sky based on their geographic
        location (latitude and longitude), viewing direction (with north at 0°), and angle above the horizon. It
        visualizes precise star positions using filtered data limited to those visible to the naked eye. To account
        for varying light pollution, the app includes a brightness filter based on stellar magnitude—ranging from 6.5
        (dark rural skies) to 2 (bright urban skies). While it doesn’t simulate atmospheric conditions like clouds, it
        provides a clear and interactive experience of how the night sky appears from any point in Earth under different
        visibility conditions.
